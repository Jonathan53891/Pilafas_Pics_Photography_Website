                        	    <br>My name is Jonathan Pilafas, and I am a freelance photographer from the northwest suburbs of Chicago.<br><br>
                        	    I began my journey in photography in mid-July of 2019, and since then I've discovered that photography is a huge passion of mine. I love being able to channel my creativity through simply taking pictures, and the fact that I'm able to show other people how I view the world from my own eyes is just such a powerful idea to think about.<br><br> 
                        	    Despite my minimal experience, I've already led or assisted with many different opportunities through photography, including but not limited to numerous portrait sessions, large group events, dance photography sessions, various urban/nature exploration excursions, and so on. <br><br>
                        		In addition, I run a very active Instagram page specifically for my photography called @pilafas.pics, which can be found through the link <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pilafas.pics/">here</a>.<br><br>
                        		Outside of photography, I am currently studying Computer Science at William Rainey Harper College in Palatine, IL, and I will obtain my B.S. in Computer Science from a 4-year institution (future school is TBD). 
                        		However, despite being preoccupied with my education pretty often, I make sure to leave plenty of time to continue pursuing my passion of photography, and I plan on continuing to be just as active as I already am in the foreseeable future.<br><br>
                        		If you are interested in working with me in any way (portrait session, collab, etc.), please don't hesistate to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>, and I'll be looking forward to potentially working with you in the near future!
